# Project Template
> [!Caution]
> Codeblocks are reversed due to a pycharm bug, reverse them if you want to use them in VSCode

This Template provides a basic structure for a python project.
It uses:
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as package manager
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for automatic documentation
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) as CI pipeline for code formatting and linting


# How to Install
> [!NOTE]
> Use this template via `git clone https://github.com/oliverstoll/python-template` to avoid the *"generated by"* note on GitHub 

### Install dependencies & pre-commit hooks 
```bash
pre-commit install
poetry install --no-root
pip install poetry
```

This by default installs only main and dev dependencies. If you want to install cloud dependencies as well, use the following command:

```bash
poetry install --with cloud
```

### Hide unnecessary files (*PyCharm*)
*Settings -> Editor -> File Types -> Ignore files and folders*
- poetry.lock
- .mypy_cache
- .pytest_cache
- .ruff_cache

### Create a Readme
When set up, you should create a new Readme File that describes the project and its usage.


# Use Project


### Run tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Serve documentation
```bash
sphinx-serve -h localhost
make html
sphinx-apidoc -t _templates -o source/ ../src
make clean
cd docs
```
