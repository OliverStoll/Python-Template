# Project Template
> [!Caution]
> Codeblocks are reversed due to a pycharm bug, revert them to use in VSCode

This Template provides a basic structure for a python project.
It uses:
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as package manager
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for documentation
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) as CI pipeline for code formatting and linting

## Prepare Project
> [!NOTE]
> Use this template via `git clone https://github.com/OliverStoll/python-template` to avoid the *generated by* note on GitHub 

Install the requirements and pre-commit hooks 
```bash
poetry install --no-root
pip install poetry
```

### Hide unnecessary folder from PyCharm
*Settings -> Editor -> File Types -> Ignore files and folders*
- poetry.lock
- .mypy_cache
- .pytest_cache
- .ruff_cache
